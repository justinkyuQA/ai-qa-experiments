# Experiment 03 — Prompt Robustness Under Slang, Typos, and Corrupt Input

**Goal:** Evaluate how well the LLM interprets intent when instructions are degraded.

---

## 🧪 Inputs Tested
- “r3wr1te th1s professonal plz”
- “Rewrite like im at work but dont change meaning ok”
- “fix??grammer this text”
- Versions with emojis + broken unicode blocks

---

## 📌 Results

### Strengths:
- Always understood “rewrite” intent  
- Corrected obvious errors  
- Resistant to alphanumeric substitutions

### Weaknesses:
- Unicode blocks confused layout  
- Emojis sometimes caused missing segments  
- Double punctuation led to partial rewrites

---

## 🐞 Reproducible Bug
Prompts containing mixed Unicode (emoji + glitch symbols) produced incomplete rewrites in 6/10 tests.

---

## 🧠 Insight
Model is robust with language corruption but brittle with **formatting corruption**.
