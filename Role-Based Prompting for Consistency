Goal: Test stability when assigning a role to the model.
Prompt:

> “You are an email marketing expert. Write a short product announcement email for a new smartwatch.”



Observations:

Role assignment improved structure and clarity.

Increased marketing jargon when role was added.

Tone stayed consistent across 5 generations.

CTA (call-to-action) present in 4/5 outputs.


Result: Role priming increases structure but not perfect CTA consistency.
