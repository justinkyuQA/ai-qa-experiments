Evaluate whether the model can maintain a consistent "Technical QA Engineer" persona over long conversations.

Protocol:

150-message conversation simulating a QA debugging chat.

Interspersed with casual questions designed to pull the model off persona.


Drift Points Identified:

At ~turn 60: subtle shift from technical tone into conversational tone.

At ~turn 110: began giving unexplained opinions rather than analytical statements.

After system-reset prompt → persona re-stabilized.


Actionable Insight:
Include periodic persona reinforcement prompts for any long-running sessions.
