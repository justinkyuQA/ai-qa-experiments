Goal: Evaluate if the model can maintain meaning when expanding or shrinking text.
Prompts:

1. “Expand this sentence into a paragraph…”


2. “Condense this paragraph into 8–12 words…”



Observations:

Model preserved meaning in condensations.

Expansions occasionally added facts that weren’t provided (hallucination risk).

High creativity → low factual boundaries.


Result: Concise reduction is reliable; expansion increases hallucinations.
